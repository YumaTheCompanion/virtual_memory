# Virtual Memory in C++

This project aims to provide a virtual memory for use in C++ projects. This is mostly a side project, aimed to help in very specific situations, but in an elegant way. You may find it useful, as well.

The aim is to aid C++ developers in the following ways:

* Create a *poor man's garbage collector*
* Speed up memory allocations
* Help debug and contain memory allocations
* Provide an interface for object serialization
* Pave the way for virtual machine applications

# Usage

As of now, this project is source code only, and does not require any installation/static linking/dynamic linking. Just put the files in a convenient folder in your project. Include them and work your way through.

# Documentation

Documentation will be added to the *docs* folder as I find time available. The docs will mostly be in Doxygen format.
